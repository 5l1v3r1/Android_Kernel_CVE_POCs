# This repository houses a series of Proofs of Concept C programs that trigger vulnerabilities that I have found in Android.

If you found these useful and you want to say thanks I like swag. Tshirts/Beer steins/coffe cups etc. Email me for more info. 

For the most up-to-date list of my bugs see https://plzdonthack.me

For the bugs listed with _mtk.c I didn't bother even trying to compile them as I don't have a mediatek device to test on.
